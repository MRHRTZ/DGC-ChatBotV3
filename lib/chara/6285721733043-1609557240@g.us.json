He's ranked as Captain of the Scouting Legion division. Levi is also the leader of the Special Operations Squad, an elite team that he hand-picked in order to protect Eren Yeager.

There are rumors that he was originally part of underground crime before he became a soldier. Although he often appears to be unfriendly, he cares deeply for his team and has never undervalued human life. He is also a notorious clean-freak.\n\nIt is later revealed that his full name is Levi Ackerman.\nNote: Levi is the official English translation by Kodansha.",
